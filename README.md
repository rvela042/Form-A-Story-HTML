# Form-A-Story!

A simple story-forming project using HTML, CSS, and JavaSript

## What this project covers: 

The purpose of a ```<form>``` is to allow users to input information and send it. 
The ```<form>```‘s action attribute determines where the form’s information goes. The ```<form>```‘s method attribute determines how the information is sent and processed. 

<br>

To add fields for users to input information we use the ```<input>``` element and set the type attribute to a field of our choosing:

- [x] Setting type to "text" creates a single row field for text input.
- [x] Setting type to "password" creates a single row field that censors text input.
- [x] Setting type to "number" creates a single row field for number input.
- [x] Setting type to "range" creates a slider to select from a range of numbers.
- [x] Setting type to "checkbox" creates a single checkbox which can be paired with other checkboxes.
- [x] Setting type to "radio" creates a radio button that can be paired with other radio buttons.
- [x] Setting type to "list" will pair the ```<input>``` with a <datalist> element if the id of both are the same.
- [x] Setting type to "submit" creates a submit button.

<br>

A ```<select>``` element is populated with ```<option>``` elements and renders a dropdown list selection. 
A ```<datalist>``` element is populated with <option> elements and works with an <input> to search through choices. 
A ```<textarea>``` element is a text input field that has a customizable area. When a ```<form>``` is submitted, the name of the fields that accept input and the value of those fields are sent as name=value pairs. 
Using the ```<form>``` element in conjunction with the other elements listed above allows us to create sites that take into consideration the wants and needs of our users.
